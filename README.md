# 🚀 Asteroid Hazard Prediction System

An end-to-end Machine Learning project that predicts whether a **Near-Earth Object (NEO)** is potentially hazardous based on its physical and orbital characteristics.

This project demonstrates:
- Classification
- Regression
- Clustering
- Model comparison
- Web-based deployment
- Research-oriented documentation

---

## 🌌 Problem Statement

Near-Earth asteroids pose a potential threat to Earth. Early identification of **Potentially Hazardous Asteroids (PHAs)** is critical for planetary defense.

This project applies multiple machine learning algorithms to predict asteroid hazard status using real astronomical data.
